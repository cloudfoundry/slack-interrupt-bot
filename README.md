# slack-interrupt-bot

Hi â€“ configuration management for the `@interrupt` bot has been migrated to a new app-specific [management site](https://interrupt.ist/). Find your team there and then you can make changes by visiting its Settings page. The management site is still evolving; if you need any help or have feedback, please share your thoughts with `@dberger`.

Moving away from this git repository-based approach was motivated by:

 * better self-management of team configuration (no PR steps or blocked merges);
 * broader access for managing channels across workspaces (no GitHub-org membership limitations);
 * improving support for testing configuration (integrated config simulation);
 * consolidating reporting and management features (no more manually-updated Data Studio dashboard); and
 * to (eventually) make the app easier to scale to other workspaces.
